aux is a mobile web application that lets you and a bunch of other people build playlists together seamlessly.

One person logs in, creates a group in the app, then pulls up the group's playlist in Spotify. From there, anyone inside a 1 kilometer radius can nominate and vote for tracks for the tracks they want to hear on the playlist next.
